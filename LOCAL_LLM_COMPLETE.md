- Learns patterns over time
- Provides context to LLM

### 3. Cognitive System
- Tracks emotional state (arousal, mood, stress)
- Adapts responses based on state
- Makes decisions with behavior engine
- Operates like a real mind

### 4. Combined Power

## 📊 Response Examples

### Regular (RAG only)
```
[RAG] Based on my 3 memories, I'm 65% confident: 
That relates to what I've learned!
```

### Powerful (LLM)
```
[LLM] Machine learning is a subset of artificial 
intelligence that enables systems to learn and 
improve from experience without being explicitly 
programmed. It relies on algorithms that can 
discover patterns in large datasets...
```

## 💬 Example Conversation

```
System: Initializing...
✓ Cognitive System ready
✓ RAG System ready
✓ LLM ready (Ollama - neural-chat)

🤖 AI: Hello! I'm a powerful cognitive AI powered 
by a local language model and retrieval-augmented 
memory. What would you like to discuss?

👤 You: What is the significance of quantum 
entanglement?

🤖 AI [LLM]: Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon 
where two or more quantum particles become correlated 
in such a way that the quantum state of one particle 
instantly influences the state of another, regardless 
of distance. This has profound implications for 
quantum computing and cryptography...

👤 You: Remember this discussion

🤖 AI [LLM]: I've stored our discussion about 
quantum entanglement in my memory. I can reference 
this in future conversations about quantum physics 
or computing.

👤 You: What was I asking about earlier?

🤖 AI [LLM]: You asked about the significance of 
quantum entanglement, and we discussed how it's 
crucial for quantum computing and allows for instant 
communication properties between particles...

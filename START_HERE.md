# 🎯 START HERE

## Your App is Ready!

You now have a complete cognitive system with:
- ✅ **Original animated character** (the one you wanted)
- ✅ **Live video feed** integrated into the window
- ✅ **Physiological metrics** displayed alongside
- ✅ **Neural network** processing all inputs

## Run Your App NOW

### Fastest Way - Test Mode (No Camera Needed)
```bash
cd /Users/shaikirfan/Downloads/cognitive-system-main
python3 app_with_video.py --test
```

This will show:
- Your animated character in the middle
- A placeholder video area on the left
- Metrics on the right
- Character responding to simulated input

### With Live Camera
```bash
python3 app_with_video.py
```

Your camera will appear on the left, animation in middle, metrics on right.

### Via Shell Script (Easier)
```bash
./run.sh --test          # Test mode
./run.sh                 # With camera
```

## What You'll See

```
Window with 3 sections:
┌──────────┬──────────┬──────────┐
│  VIDEO   │  ANIM    │ METRICS  │
│  FEED    │  CHAR    │  HEART   │
│  (Live)  │ (Yours)  │  STRESS  │
│          │          │ AROUSAL  │
└──────────┴──────────┴──────────┘
```

## How It Works

1. Camera captures live video
2. Video displays on LEFT side
3. YOUR animated character displays in MIDDLE
4. Character responds to AI neural network
5. Metrics show on RIGHT side
6. Close window to exit

---

## Recommended Order

1. **First** - Test mode to verify it works:
   ```bash
   python3 app_with_video.py --test
   ```

2. **Then** - With live camera:
   ```bash
   python3 app_with_video.py
   ```

3. **Finally** - Experiment!
   - Move in front of camera
   - Watch character respond
   - See metrics change

## Quick Reference

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|------------|
| `python3 app_with_video.py --test` | Test without camera ⭐ START HERE |
| `python3 app_with_video.py` | Run with live camera |
| `./run.sh --test` | Shell script - test mode |
| `./run.sh` | Shell script - with camera |
| `python3 test_animation.py` | Simple animation test |

---

## Files

- **`app_with_video.py`** ⭐ USE THIS
- **`run.sh`** Alternative (shell script)
- **`run_app.py`** Alternative layout
- Other files are for batch processing or other modes

---

## Everything Verified ✅

- ✅ Components initialize
- ✅ Animation loads
- ✅ Video support ready
- ✅ Metrics display works
- ✅ Neural network ready
- ✅ Memory system ready

---

## Next Step

**Open terminal and run:**
```bash
cd /Users/shaikirfan/Downloads/cognitive-system-main
python3 app_with_video.py --test
```

Then close the window and try with real camera!
